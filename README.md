# Hello-World
Just another practice start-up repository

I used to be young, smart, fast and deep learner, and not dedicated.
Now I'm old, very smart in some ways, dumb in others and a slow learner, but am more dedicated.
My creativity is so high it's a downfall, but I wouldn't change it for the world.
Process analysis is awesome.  I live for it.
