# Hello-World
Just another practice start-up repository.

I used to be young, smart, fast and deep learner, dedicated to thinking, but not to doing.
Now I'm old, very smart in some ways, dumb in others and a slow learner, but am more dedicated to doing.
My creativity is so high it's a downfall, but I wouldn't change it for the world.
Process analysis is awesome.  I live for it.

Have maintained a 4.0 for 30 years; mostly in STEM.
